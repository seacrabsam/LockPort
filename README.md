# LockPort
LockPort. Easy warlock summoning for turtle wow.

Addon orginally written by Gurky. I am just rehosting it.

## Requirments

- Be a Warlock!

## How it works:

- You must be in a raid group.
- If someone types 123 in Yell, Whisper, Party, Raid, or Raid Leader the Player name gets added to the LockPort list and is synced accros all LockPort users. Any user added to the list will also trigger a sound alert to let the Warlocks know someone is on the list (Sound is subject to change). 
- Leftclick to move the frame.
- Type /lockport to show or hide the LockPort Window.  
- Left click to Summon.
- CTRL + Left click to target the player.
- Right click to remove.
- If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /lockport to manually show).

## Options:

- /lockport help - Shows commands in chat.
- /lockport show - Shows the current summon list.
- /lockport zone - Enables or Disables including Zone information in summoning messages.
- /lockport whisper - Enables or Disables whispering the target when summoning.
- /lockport shards - Enables or Disables shard count message when you summon.
- /lockport settings - Opens the settings window.
